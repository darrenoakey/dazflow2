Let me try enabling it again:The workflow file was written but the API doesn't see it yet. Let me verify the file exists and check if there's a different workflow path:I see - the workflow was created, but the directory structure might be different. Let me check where the other workflows are:Ah, the actual dazflow2 repo is at `/Volumes/T9/darrenoakey/src/dazflow2`. Let me find the correct workflows directory:Found it. The correct path is `/Volumes/T9/darrenoakey/src/dazflow2/local/work/workflows/`. Let me create the workflow in the correct location:Now let me enable it:Done! I've created and enabled the workflow **offload-videos.json** with:\n\n- **Schedule**: Runs every 36 hours\n- **Command**: `python offload_videos.py`\n- **Working directory**: `/Users/darrenoakey/big/3d printing/videos`\n- **Status**: \u2705 Enabled\n\nThe workflow will automatically trigger every 36 hours and run your video offloading script."
